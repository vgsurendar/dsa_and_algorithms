The idea is to merge the characters alternatively from each of the index of the 2 words.

Say word1[0] word2[0] word1[1] word2[1]

It is clear that the length of the merged word will be the strlen(word1) + strlen(word2) + 1 (For null termination)

We'll declare a new variable called new_word and pass the characters from either variables (word1 and word2) in for loop

    for (i = 0; i < len1 || i < len2; i++) {

        if (i < len1) {
            new_word[k++] = word1[i];
        }

        if (i < len2) {
            new_word[k++] = word2[i];
        }
    }

In the for loop, we will pass the character to the new_word from each variable word1 and word2
