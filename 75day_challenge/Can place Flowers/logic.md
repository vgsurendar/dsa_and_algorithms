The function `canPlaceFlowers` determines whether we can plant `n` new flowers in a given `flowerbed` without violating the rule that no two flowers can be planted in adjacent plots.

The input parameters are:
- `flowerbed`: an integer array representing the flowerbed, where `0` means an empty plot and `1` means a plot already has a flower.
- `flowerbedSize`: the size of the flowerbed array.
- `n`: the number of flowers to plant.

The function returns `true` (1) if it's possible to plant all `n` flowers, otherwise `false` (0).

### **Algorithm:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - We declare an integer variable `i = 0`, which will be used as the index for iterating through the flowerbed array.
   
2. **Main Loop:**
   - We start a loop that iterates through the flowerbed array from index `0` to `flowerbedSize - 1`.

3. **Checking if a Flower can be Planted:**
   - For each index `i`, we check if a flower can be planted at that position (`flowerbed[i] == 0`) and if the adjacent plots (left and right) are empty or out of bounds (indicating no adjacent flowers).
   - We break this condition into three parts:
     - **Current plot `flowerbed[i] == 0`:** The current plot must be empty.
     - **Left adjacent plot `i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0`:** Either the current plot is the first one in the array (so there’s no left neighbor), or the left adjacent plot is empty.
     - **Right adjacent plot `i == (flowerbedSize - 1) || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0`:** Either the current plot is the last one in the array (so there’s no right neighbor), or the right adjacent plot is empty.

4. **Planting a Flower:**
   - If the condition in step 3 is satisfied, we:
     - Set `flowerbed[i] = 1` to plant a flower in the current plot.
     - Decrement `n` by 1 (since one flower has been successfully planted).
   
5. **Early Exit:**
   - After planting a flower, we check if `n == 0`. If `n` is 0, it means we have successfully planted all the required flowers, and we return `true` (1).

6. **Loop Exit and Final Check:**
   - If the loop finishes (i.e., we have checked all plots in the flowerbed) and `n > 0`, it means we were not able to plant all `n` flowers. Therefore, we return `false` (0).
   - The final return statement `return n <= 0` ensures that the function will return `true` if we managed to plant all flowers during the loop.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example Input:**
- `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
- `n = 1`

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **i = 0:** 
   - `flowerbed[i] == 1`, so we cannot plant here. Move to the next index.

2. **i = 1:** 
   - `flowerbed[i] == 0`, but `flowerbed[i-1] == 1`, meaning the left plot is occupied. We cannot plant here. Move to the next index.

3. **i = 2:** 
   - `flowerbed[i] == 0`, `flowerbed[i-1] == 0`, and `flowerbed[i+1] == 0`. All conditions are satisfied, so we plant a flower at `flowerbed[2]`. The flowerbed becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`. Decrement `n` to 0.
   - Since `n == 0`, we return `true` immediately without checking the rest of the array.

### **Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity is **O(flowerbedSize)**, where `flowerbedSize` is the number of plots in the flowerbed. We iterate through the array once.

### **Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is **O(1)** because no additional space is used except for a few variables (`i` and `n`).
