# [345. Reverse Vowels of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`, and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

**Example 1:** 

<div class="example-block">
Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in `s` are `['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']`. On reversing the vowels, s becomes `"AceCreIm"`.

**Example 2:** 

<div class="example-block">
Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- `s` consist of **printable ASCII**  characters.
